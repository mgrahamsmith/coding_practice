Chapter 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `Exercise 1-1`_: Run the "hello, world" program on your system.  Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.
* `Exercise 1-2`_: Experiment to find out what happens when printf's argument string contains \c, where c is some character not listed above.
* `Exercise 1-3`_: Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.
* `Exercise 1-4`_: Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.
* `Exercise 1-5`_: Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.
* `Section 1.4 Example`_: Symbolic Constants
* `Section 1.5.1 Example`_: File Copying
* `Exercise 1-6`_: Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1.
* `Exercise 1-7`_: Write a program to print the value of EOF.
* `Exercise 1-8`_: Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.
* `Exercise 1-9`_: Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.
* `Section 1.5.2 Example`_: Character Counting
* `Section 1.5.3 Example`_: Line Counting
* `Exercise 1-10`_: Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\.  This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.
